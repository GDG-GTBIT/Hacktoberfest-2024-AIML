# From Scratch Projects

Greetings, this folder will contain Deep Learning Models which would be implemented from scratch without using any library such as PyTorch or Tensorflow(Keras). 

So that's right, everything here would be purely hardcoded from scratch using nothing but numpy and other low level libraries. For now, the models in consideration would be
- Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)
- Long Short Term Memory Network(LSTMs)
Additional implementations such as those of ANNs can and will be appreciated but only once these projects have been covered. 

## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
For this category, we will be implementing the following parts of operations of a model in different script files:
- Forward pass
- Backward pass
- Optimization loop
- Training


Implement each operation as a separate feature which will be implemented as a separate Pull Request. Take a look at the main README for an idea about how to do so.


Kindly also make sure your dependencies(packages) are installed through [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
