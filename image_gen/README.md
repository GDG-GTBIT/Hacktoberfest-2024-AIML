# Image Generation
This folder is for any projects related to Image Generation. Anything from autoencoders, GANs, its variants, Diffusion models, or any other idea you might have regarding image gen.

# Contribution Guidelines
Notebooks are fine for the submissions, but try to explain each step and your plans using Markdown and comments in as many places as possible. 
Also appreciated would be type hinting and documenting any sufficiently complicated functions

Also also, use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) for package dependencies

Other than this there are no restrictions, so be creative and have fun!
