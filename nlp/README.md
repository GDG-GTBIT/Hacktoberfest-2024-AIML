# Natural Language Processing
This category involves dealing with any and all projects under NLP, be it API calls to embedding models, LLMs, query engines or tasks such as sentiment analysis, NER. 


## CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES
There are no specific guidelines about any one or two kinds of projects in this, all we ask of you is to keep it simple and structured appropriately as a proper project. Pure jupyter notebook submissions containing the project work cell by cell will be considered half-assed works and will not be merged into the repository. 

Also make sure your dependencies(packages) are installed through [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). 


Here are some ideas:
- Sentiment analysis of news articles
- Named Entity recognition across different kinds of text
- Text Summarization
- RAG system with Langgraph and Langsmith monitoring

Or, literally anything you can think of.

Creation of your own APIs for running the services is very much appreciated and both encouraged as it will go a long way towards your development.
